1. From the ** AWS services** list, search for and select **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\)** or ** AWS Fargate**\.

   In the **Service quotas** list, you can see the service quota name, applied value \(if itâ€™s available\), AWS default quota, and whether the quota value is adjustable\.

 AWS CLI  
\* \.To view Amazon EKS and Fargate service quotas using the AWS CLI Run the following command to view your Amazon EKS quotas\.  

```
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code eks \
    --output table
```
Run the following command to view your Fargate quotas\.  

```
aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas \
    --query 'Quotas[*].{Adjustable:Adjustable,Name:QuotaName,Value:Value,Code:QuotaCode}' \
    --service-code fargate \
    --output table
```
The quota returned is the number of Amazon ECS tasks or Amazon EKS Pods that can run concurrently on Fargate in this account in the current AWS Region\.

To work more with service quotas using the AWS CLI, see [service\-quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/index.html) in the * AWS CLI Command Reference*\. To request a quota increase, see the [request\-service\-quota\-increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/request-service-quota-increase.html) command in the * AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

## Service quotas<a name="sq-text"></a>

**Note**  
The default values are the initial quotas set by AWS\. These default values are separate from the actual applied quota values and maximum possible service quotas\. For more information, see [Terminology in Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

These service quotas are listed under **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\)** in the Service Quotas console\. To request a quota increase for values that are shown as adjustable, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

## AWS Fargate service quotas<a name="service-quotas-eks-fargate"></a>

New AWS accounts might have lower initial quotas that can increase over time\. Fargate constantly monitors the account usage within each AWS Region, and then automatically increases the quotas based on the usage\. You can also request a quota increase for values that are shown as adjustable\. For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

Fargate On\-Demand vCPU resource count

The number of Fargate vCPUs that can run concurrently as Fargate On\-Demand in this account in the current Region\.

**Note**  
The default values are the initial quotas set by AWS\. These default values are separate from the actual applied quota values and maximum possible service quotas\. For more information, see [Terminology in Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

**Note**  
Fargate additionally enforces Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS Pods launch rate quotas\. For more information, see [AWS Fargate throttling quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/throttling.html) in the *Amazon ECS guide*\.
