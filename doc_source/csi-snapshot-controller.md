# CSI snapshot controller<a name="csi-snapshot-controller"></a>

The Container Storage Interface \(CSI\) snapshot controller enables the use of snapshotting functionality in compatible CSI drivers, such as the Amazon EBS CSI driver\.

Here are some things to consider when using the CSI snapshot controller\.

Alternatively, if you want a self\-managed installation of the Amazon EBS CSI snapshot controller, see [Usage](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/blob/master/README.md#usage) in the upstream Kubernetes `external-snapshotter` on GitHub\.
