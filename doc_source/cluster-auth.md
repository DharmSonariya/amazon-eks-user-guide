# Manage access<a name="cluster-auth"></a>

Learn how to manage access to your Amazon EKS cluster\. Using Amazon EKS requires knowledge of how both Kubernetes and AWS Identity and Access Management \(AWS IAM\) handle access control\.

 **This section includes:** 

 **Common Tasks:** 
+ Grant developers access to the Kubernetes API\. View Kubernetes resources in the AWS Management Console\.
+ Configure kubectl to talk to an Amazon EKS cluster using AWS Credentials\.
+ Use an external identity provider, such as Ping Identity, to authenticate users to the Kubernetes API\.
+ Grant workloads on your Kubernetes cluster the ability to call AWS APIs\.

\*Background: \*
+  [Learn how Kubernetes Service Accounts work\.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) 
+  [Review the Kubernetes Role Based Access Control \(RBAC\) Model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) 
+ For more information about managing access to AWS resources, see the [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html)\.
