# Creating Amazon EKS resources with AWS CloudFormation<a name="creating-resources-with-cloudformation"></a>

Amazon EKS is integrated with AWS CloudFormation, a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and infrastructure\. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want, for example an Amazon EKS cluster, and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you\.

When you use AWS CloudFormation, you can reuse your template to set up your Amazon EKS resources consistently and repeatedly\. Just describe your resources once, and then provision the same resources over and over in multiple AWS accounts and Regions\.

## Amazon EKS and AWS CloudFormation templates<a name="working-with-templates"></a>

Amazon EKS supports creating clusters and node groups in AWS CloudFormation\. For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates for your Amazon EKS resources, see \{https\-\-\-docs\-aws\-amazon\-com\-AWSCloudFormation\-latest\-UserGuide\-AWS\-EKS\-html\}\[Amazon EKS resource type reference\] in the * AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.
