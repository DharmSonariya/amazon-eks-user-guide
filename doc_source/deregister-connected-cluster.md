# Deregistering a cluster<a name="deregister-connected-cluster"></a>

If you are finished using a connected cluster, you can deregister it\. After itâ€™s deregistered, the cluster is no longer visible in the Amazon EKS console\.

You must have the following permissions to call the deregisterCluster API:
+  `eks:DeregisterCluster` 
+  `ssm:DeleteActivation` 
+  `ssm:DeregisterManagedInstance` 

This process involves two steps: Deregistering the cluster with Amazon EKS and uninstalling the eks\-connector agent in the cluster\.

## To deregister the Kubernetes cluster<a name="deregister-connected-cluster-eks"></a>

 AWS CLI  
\*  
+  AWS CLI must be installed\. To install or upgrade it, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)\.
+ Ensure the Amazon EKS Connector agent role was created\. \.
Deregister the connected cluster\.  
\+  

```
aws eks deregister-cluster \
    --name my-cluster \
    --region region-code
```

 AWS Management Console  

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/eks/home\#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)\.

1. Choose **Clusters**\.

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the connected cluster and select **Deregister**\.

1. Confirm that you want to deregister the cluster\.

eksctl  
\*  
+ Ensure the Amazon EKS Connector agent role was created\. \.

  ```
  eksctl deregister cluster --name my-cluster
  ```

## To clean up the resources in your Kubernetes cluster<a name="deregister-connected-cluster-k8s"></a>

Helm  

1. Run the following command to uninstall the agent\.

   ```
   helm -n eks-connector uninstall eks-connector
   ```

YAML manifest  

1. Delete the Amazon EKS Connector YAML file from your Kubernetes cluster\.

   ```
   kubectl delete -f eks-connector.yaml
   ```

1. If you created `clusterrole` or `clusterrolebindings` for additional [IAM principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html) to access the cluster, delete them from your Kubernetes cluster\.
