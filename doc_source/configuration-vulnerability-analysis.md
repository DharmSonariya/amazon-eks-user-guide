# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in Amazon EKS<a name="configuration-vulnerability-analysis"></a>

Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining Kubernetes clusters and applications\. The following lists resources for you to analyze the security configuration of your EKS clusters, resources for you to check for vulnerabilities, and integrations with AWS services that can do that analysis for you\.

## The Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) benchmark for Amazon EKS<a name="configuration-vulnerability-analysis-cis"></a>

The [Center for Internet Security \(CIS\) Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) provides guidance for Amazon EKS security configurations\. The benchmark:
+ Is applicable to Amazon EC2 nodes \(both managed and self\-managed\) where you are responsible for security configurations of Kubernetes components\.
+ Provides a standard, community\-approved way to ensure that you have configured your Kubernetes cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS\.
+ Consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services\.
+ Supports all of the Kubernetes versions currently available in Amazon EKS and can be run using [kube\-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench), a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on Kubernetes clusters\.
