Before you use Amazon EKS Connector, understand the following:

You can request an increase through the [service quota console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html)\. See [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) for more information\.
+ Only the Amazon EKS `RegisterCluster`, `ListClusters`, `DescribeCluster`, and `DeregisterCluster` APIs are supported for external Kubernetes clusters\.
+ You must have the following permissions to register a cluster:
  + eks:RegisterCluster
  + ssm:CreateActivation
  + ssm:DeleteActivation
  + iam:PassRole
+ You must have the following permissions to deregister a cluster:
