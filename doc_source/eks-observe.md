# Observability in Amazon EKS<a name="eks-observe"></a>

You can observe your data in Amazon EKS using many available monitoring or logging tools\. Your Amazon EKS log data can be streamed to AWS services or to partner tools for data analysis\. There are many services available in the AWS Management Console that provide data for troubleshooting your Amazon EKS issues\. You can also use an AWS\-supported open\-source solution for [monitoring Amazon EKS infrastructure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/solution-eks.html)\.

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon EKS and your AWS solutions\. We recommend that you collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution\. That way, you can more easily debug a multi\-point failure if one occurs\. Before you start monitoring Amazon EKS, make sure that your monitoring plan addresses the following questions\.
+ What are your goals? Do you need real\-time notifications if your clusters scale dramatically?
+ What resources need to be observed?
+ How frequently do you need to observe these resources? Does your company want to respond quickly to risks?
+ Who you do intend to perform the monitoring tasks?
+ Whom do you want notifications to be sent to when something goes wrong?

## Logging and monitoring on Amazon EKS<a name="logging-monitoring"></a>

Amazon EKS provides built\-in tools for logging and monitoring\. Control plane logging records all API calls to your clusters, audit information capturing what users performed what actions to your clusters, and role\-based information\. For more information, see [Logging and monitoring on Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/amazon-eks-logging-monitoring.html) in the * AWS Prescriptive Guidance*\.

**Note**  
When you check the Amazon EKS authenticator logs in Amazon CloudWatch, the entries are displayed that contain text similar to the following example text\.  

```
level=info msg="mapping IAM role" groups="[]" role="arn:aws:iam::`111122223333`:role/`XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`-NodeManagerRole-`XXXXXXXX`" username="eks:node-manager"
```
Entries that contain this text are expected\. The `username` is an Amazon EKS internal service role that performs specific operations for managed node groups and Fargate\.  
For low\-level, customizable logging, then [Kubernetes logging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) is available\.

To configure Fluent Bit for custom Amazon CloudWatch logs, see [Setting up Fluent Bit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-logs-FluentBit.html#Container-Insights-FluentBit-setup) in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\.

## Amazon EKS logging and monitoring tools<a name="eks-monitor-tools"></a>

Amazon Web Services provides various tools that you can use to monitor Amazon EKS\. You can configure some tools to set up automatic monitoring, but some require manual calls\. We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as your environment and existing toolset allows\.

**Logging Tools**  
Applications

 [Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) 

It collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices\.

 [Setup procedure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-setup-EKS-quickstart.html) 

Control plane

It logs API calls by a user, role, or service\.

 [Setup procedure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html) 

Multiple areas for AWS Fargate instances

For AWS Fargate instances, it streams logs to AWS services or partner tools\. Uses [AWS for Fluent Bit](https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit)\. Logs can be streamed to other AWS services or partner tools\.

**Monitoring Tools**  
Applications

 [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html) 

CloudWatch Container Insights collects, aggregates, and summarizes metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices\.

 [Setup procedure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html) 

Applications

 [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry \(ADOT\)](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction) 

It collects and sends correlated metrics, trace data, and metadata to AWS monitoring services or partners\. It can be set up through CloudWatch Container Insights\.

Applications

 [Amazon DevOpsÂ Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-devops-guru-coverage-amazon-eks-metrics-cluster/) 

It detects node\-level operational performance and availability\.

 [Setup procedure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html) 

Applications

 [AWS X\-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html) 

It receives trace data about your application\. This trace data includes ingoing and outgoing requests and metadata about the requests\. For Amazon EKS, the implementation requires the OpenTelemetry add\-on\.

 [Setup procedure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-instrumenting-your-app.html) 

Control plane

CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to enabled control plane logs\.

 [Setup procedure](https://prometheus.io/)
