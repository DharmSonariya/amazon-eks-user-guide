 AWS Resilience Hub assesses the resiliency of an Amazon EKS cluster by analyzing its infrastructure\. AWS Resilience Hub uses the Kubernetes role\-based access control \(RBAC\) configuration to assess the Kubernetes workloads deployed to your cluster\. For more information, see [Enabling AWS Resilience Hub access to your Amazon EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/enabling-eks-in-arh.html) in the AWS Resilience Hub User Guide\.
